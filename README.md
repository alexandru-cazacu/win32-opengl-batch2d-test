- Simple 2d batch renderer made with OpenGL
- Borderless window with custom border (no interaction, just graphics)
- Windows Icon

# Building from source

## Windows <img src="./media/windows-logo.png" width=24 valign="middle">

`cl` should be available in `PATH`. Search `Developer Command Prompt from VS 2019` and launch it. Use that terminal or run `./shell_win-x64.bat`. Then run one of the build scripts:

```shell
./build-debug.bat
./build-release.bat
./build-tests.bat
```

After that the relative binary will be generated

```
./bin/Win-x64-Debug/Hyped.exe
./bin/Win-x64-Release/Hyped.exe
./bin/Win-x64-Tests/Hyped.exe
```

If you have `4coder` the process is quite simple. Just use one of the function keys.
